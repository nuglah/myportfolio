# <My Portfolio>

## Description

A single paged website containing information about me and links to work I've done and ways to contact me. The page will be a portfolio for potential employers to contact me and see  my previous work. Also was an oppurtunity to use css techniques I've learned and apply them to making a webpage from scratch. Required lots of resecarch on the internet to get things positioned how I wanted them on the page. It's in a state where apps can be added later when completed.



## Installation

The Github repository has an active Github pages link.

## Usage
Simply has links in the top right in desktop and in column when using tablet or mobile. The links take you to the respective section of the page. The resume will contain a resume when I've made one. The links in the contact section at the bottom take you to My Github and my LinkedIn page. The cards in the work section don't yet lead anywhere but they will when I've completed some apps.
