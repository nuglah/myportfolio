# <My Portfolio>

## Description

A single paged website containing information about me and links to work I've done and ways to contact me. The page will be a portfolio for potential employers to contact me and see  my previous work. Also was an oppurtunity to use css techniques I've learned and apply them to making a webpage from scratch. Required lots of resecarch on the internet to get things positioned how I wanted them on the page. It's in a state where apps can be added later when completed.



## Installation

The Github repository has an active Github pages link.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ![alt text](assets/images/<img width="1527" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-27 at 1 16 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98041369/176012006-bb5f80ec-25da-4ac3-b2e2-ce721b7a53a8.png">)
